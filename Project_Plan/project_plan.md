##Abstract

Nowadays, most industries are widely using the automatic robotic systems
in manufacturing processes because of productivity, efficiency and so
on. However, in most of industries, monitoring of these processes are
still done by human operators. The objective of this project is to
monitor robotic processes by using intelligent sensors, perform the
quality assurance by microcontroller and control the actions of the
robot remotely. In order to remotely monitor robot arm and its working
environment, different kinds of sensors are employed. 3D depth camera is
used to capture the images and send them to microcontroller. The system
also includes other sensors like temperature probe, force and dust
sensors to monitor the working environment. Arduino board is used to
control robotic arms and sensors. By using Jetson TK1, it can process
the image and measure the depth of the objects. It then creates the
point cloud image and identify the scratches or abnormalities. Depending
on the results, it will perform its action and alert the operator. The
notification alert includes the possible roots of the failure then the
operator can fix the fault effectively.

##Reasons that I love about Computer Vision

According to Mobile marketing statics, total number of smartphone users
is over 2 billion people. As almost everyone is using smartphones and
pictures can be taken easily, pictures are a big part of our lives. If
we, programmers and researchers, can make computers understand the
images easily and accurately, most of the current daily tasks can be
done automatically. Furthermore, it will also creates limitless
applications and software for developers. It will then affects and
improves our lifestyles.

**Hardware resources**

-   Jetson TK1

<!-- -->

-   Arduino board

<!-- -->

-   Kinect

<!-- -->

-   Force Sensor

<!-- -->

-   Temperature Probe

<!-- -->

-   Dust Sensor

**Software resources**

-   Linux Operating System (Ubuntu)

<!-- -->

-   Computer Vision Libraries (OpenCV, etc)

<!-- -->

-   Robot Operating System

<!-- -->

-   Point Cloud Library

**Language**

-   C++

-   C

As most of the hardware and software resources are still new to me, I
will have to put more effort than others to learn these functionalities.
There are multiple tutorials and references online for Linux OS and ROS.

I am currently taking Computer Vision specialisation course, therefore,
I can learn more about vision technologies and their applications. As
for vision libraries, openCV is the reliable site for practical
purposes. I am familiar with C and C++ language, therefore computer
language is not an obstacle for me.
